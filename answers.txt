// How do we get the name of an enumeration value?
//ex: equipment.name();

    // What is a try/catch block and why do we need one?
	  //Try/catch block will catch an exception if there is one. An exception will be thrown if the input file is not found. That's why we need a try/catch block. 

    // What is an exception?
	  //It's a way of catching errors without crashing the program. For example, if you try to divide by zero an exception with be thrown.
